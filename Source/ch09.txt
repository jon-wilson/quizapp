Short Answer


1. Explain the object persistence format type known as files.

Ans: There are four main types of object-persistence formats: files (sequential and random access), relational database management systems, object-relational database management systems, and object-oriented database management systems. Files are good for transaction processing systems but have poor future prospects. The major weakness of files is redundant data. This weakness is a significant limitation. Though files can be designed for fast performance and are good for short-term storage, their usage is very limited for new data storage. An unordered sequential file is an electronic list of information that is stored on a disk. Ordered sequential files store information in a specific order (for example, by customer id). Random access files allow only random or direct file operations to be performed, and are optimized for such operations.


2. Explain the object persistence format type known as Relational databases.

Ans: Relational database management systems (RDBMS) currently lead the database market because they are able to handle diverse data needs. RDBMS are good for transaction processing systems and decision making. RDBMS have good future prospects. A relational database is based on collections of tables with each table having a primary key, a field whose value is unique for every row in the table. Most RDBMS support referential integrity, which forces the tables linked by the primary key-foreign key relationships to be correctly synchronized. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for accessing data in RDBMS. IBM DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server are all examples of RDBMS systems.


3. Explain the object persistence format type known as Object-relational databases.

Ans: Object-relational database management systems are relational databases that have extensions that provide limited support for object-orientation. The extensions typically include some support for the storage of objects in the relational table structure. This is typically done through the use of a user-defined type. Currently, IBM Db2, Oracle, and Informix all have some level of support for storing objects. Many of the ORDBMS still do not support several object-oriented features including inheritance.




4. Explain the object persistence format type known as Object Oriented Databases.

Ans: Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) are able to handle complex data but the technology behind OODBMS is still maturing and skilled OO professions are hard to find. These systems can be used for transaction processing but they have an uncertain future. With an OODBMS, collections of objects are associated with an extent. An extent is a set of instances associated with a specific class (similar to a table in an RDBMS). Each instance has a unique Object ID. OODBMS maintains referential integrity by tracking the object relations using the Object ID. OODBMS support some form of inheritance; one problem with supporting inheritance is that it tends to be language dependent. OODBMS also support the idea of repeating groups and multivalues attributes.


5. Information systems consultants, Drew and Becky, have just visited the site of a potential customer. Video-Audio-Images Extra, Inc., is an old established organization that was one of the first companies to videotape weddings, high school musicals, and church presentations. Today they have transformed into a multinational company that performs audio and video recording and mixing, digital re-mastering, and computer graphics for feature films, MTV videos, commercials and video games. During the interview Becky learned that the company has a legacy database system that should soon be replaced. The new system should be able to handle only accounting, purchasing, human resources, and inventory control for the company. What object persistence format would you recommend to Becky and Drew? Support your answer.

Ans: I would recommend a relational database management system to Becky and Drew. Though Video-Audio-Images Extra, Inc. is a company that does high-tech computer applications, it is currently looking for a system that will run the business end of the organization. Relational database management systems are currently the industry leader in transaction processing systems, which include accounting, purchasing, human resources and inventory control.


6. Explain the difference in the way Structured Query Language processes data compared to traditional programs.

Ans: The key difference is that traditional programs operate on files, and the files must be processed record by record. Structured Query Language operates of complete tables as opposed to the individual records in the tables. When a query deals with data from more than one table, the tables are joined to create a new, larger table, which is then operated on by the SQL commands.




7. What is the role of the following file types: master, look-up, transaction, audit, and history?

Ans: The master file stores core information for the business, such as customer information or order information. They are usually kept for long periods of time with new records appended to the end. Look-up files contain static values, such as valid zip codes, against which user input can be validated. A transaction file holds information temporarily until it is used to update a master file. An audit file records before and after images of data as it is altered so that an audit can be performed if the integrity of the data is questioned. A history file is used to store information that is no longer actively used. This file archives the old records, typically off-line, so they can be accessed if needed but so they will not slow down the system.

8. What is the concept of referential integrity? Why is it important in databases?

Ans: Referential integrity is the idea of ensuring that values linking the tables together through the use of primary and foreign keys are valid and correctly synchronized. This makes sure that data are not entered in one table (e.g., the order table) without corresponding data in the related table (e.g., customer).


9. Describe the differences between an ORDBMS and an OODBMS, and list the advantages of using an OODBMS over an OODBMS.

Ans: The OODBMS leaves the relational model aside. It does implement something called an extent which functions much like a table. While the system generates a unique identifier for each object, it is still good to have an attribute with a unique value for each instance. The OODBMS provide some language dependent form of inheritance and some complex data forms such as repeating groups and multi-valued attributes.

Being based on established technology, the systems tend to be more mature and have a broader range of personnel with appropriate skill sets.


10. Describe the differences between Relational DB and NoSQL Data Store.

Ans: The major strengths of Relational DB are they are leaders in the database market, and they Can handle diverse data needs, and NoSQL can handle complex data. The data types support in Relational DB is simple, but NoSQL supports simple and complex data types. Relational DB is mainly for handling transaction processing and decision making, but NoSQL is optimized for decision making, which emphasizes performance than consistency.



11. When implementing the object persistence in an ORDBMS, what types of issues must you address?

Ans: The mapping between problem domain layer and the data management layer is not straightforward with the ORDBMS. First, the mapping will vary with the specific language and tools used. There is a need to map the problem domain classes to both data management classes and tables in the data management layer. There are nine rules that should be followed for implementing this mapping that mostly focus on dealing with complex data forms such as repeating groups of attributes.


12. Why should the object persistent classes be dependent on the associated problem domain classes instead of the other way around?

Ans: It is recommended that the data management functionality specifics, such as retrieval and updating of data from the object storage, be included only in classes contained in the Data Management layer. This will ensure that the Data Management classes are dependent on the Problem Domain classes and not the other way around. Furthermore, this allows the design of Problem Domain classes to be independent of any specific object persistence environment, thus increasing their portability and their potential for reuse. This one also implies additional processing. However, the increased portability and potential for reuse realized should more than compensate for the additional processing required.
