Short Answer


1. What are the methods used to identify improvement opportunities during business process improvement? How do the methods used for each analysis strategy affect the outcome of the “identify improvement” process?

Ans: The methods used to identify improvements during business process improvement are duration analysis, activity-based costing, and informal benchmarking. Duration analysis requires a detailed examination of the amount of time it takes to process inputs in the as-is system. First the process time is determined for the entire system. Then the time is determined for each sub-process in the system. The times for the basic sub-processes are then totaled and compared to the total time for the overall system process. When there are significant differences between the two, analysts, users and managers look for solutions such as parallelization and process integration.

Activity-based costing is similar to duration analysis except it examines the cost of each major process or step in a business process instead of the time. The analyst identifies the costs associated with each basic function and focuses attention on improving the most expensive activities.

During informal benchmarking the business processes of other organizations are studied to identify new and better ideas. The implementation of these new ideas may bring value to the organization.

The outcome of duration analysis is normally a change in the as-is business process. The outcome of activity-based costing is normally a reduction in direct costs, but may also affect indirect costs. Informal benchmarking commonly affects customer-facing business processes such as web site appearances and customer satisfaction issues.




2. What are the three types of interview questions? Define and identify why an analyst would use each type of question. Include an example of each question type.

Ans: The three types of interview questions are closed-ended, open-ended, and probing. Closed-ended questions are questions that require a specific answer. Analysts use closed-ended question when they are looking for specific, precise information. An example of a closed-ended question is “How many telephone orders are received per day?”

Open-ended questions are questions that leave room for the interviewee to elaborate. Analysts use open-ended questions to gather rich information and to give the interviewee more control over the information that is revealed during the interview. An example of an open-ended question is “What do you think about the current system?”

Probing questions follow up on what has just been discussed in order for the analyst to learn more and are often used when the interviewer is unclear about what the interviewee’s answer. Probing questions encourage the interviewee to expand or confirm information from a previous response and they are a signal that the interviewer is listening and is interested in the topic. An example of a probing question is “Why?”


3. Document analysis and observation are two requirement gathering techniques. Briefly describe each and compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages.

Ans: To understand the As-Is system, project teams often use document analysis. Hopefully, the project team that designed the As-Is system produced adequate data and process models, and all of the paper documents (forms, reports, policy manuals, etc.) necessary to provide an understanding of the system. A project team can learn much about the formal As-Is system from this type of analysis.

Observation enables the analyst to see how the As-Is system actually operates, which may differ from the system outlined in the documentation. The analyst becomes an anthropologist as he or she observes the business functions, much the same way monkeys have been studied in Africa.

The advantages of document analysis are (1) it provides a starting point for the analyst and (2) it indicates clearly that a new system is necessary if users have begun to create, make changes to, or leave blanks on documents, reports and forms. The disadvantage is that many systems are not well documented.

The advantage of observation is that the analyst actually sees and can check the reality of the system, which may differ greatly from the documentation or the reports given during an interview. The disadvantages are that (1) observation is time intensive, (2) it disrupts workers, and (3) it may not be honest because people behave differently (more carefully) when observed.


4. Describe the most common way that the analyst organizes the interview process in terms of structured versus unstructured, and also in terms of open-ended, closed-ended, and probing questions.

Ans: Although there is no hard and fast rule, it is usually best to begin the interviewing process with unstructured interviews that consist primarily of open-ended questions. At this point, the analyst will probably not know enough to ask very specific questions, and so should be seeking to gain a broad understanding of the situation. As more is learned, the analyst can use more probing questions to dig deeper. After the analyst has developed a good idea of the major issues, the interviews can become more structured, with more specific, closed-ended questions being effective in confirming facts and impressions.


5. During an interview, the analyst has been asking about the process used to identify and correct the number of poor-quality products produced on a manufacturing line. The analyst commented, "This process seems way too slow and complicated. I don't know how you people can function if this is the way things are done." Is this an appropriate comment for the interviewer to make? Why or why not?

Ans: This is not an appropriate statement. There are two serious problems with this statement. First, it is an opinion statement. Analysts should be objective collectors of information. They are not there to provide commentary. Second, the remark is derogatory in nature. What if the person he is interviewing is the one who designed that process? The interviewee will be offended and may withdraw his/her support for the project. This attitude may spread to other users and may diminish the chance of a successful project outcome. The analyst needs to stay neutral whenever interacting with the project sponsors, users, and managers.


6. What is the primary goal of observation? What are three ways to make observation more effective? How reliable are the results of observation?

Ans: The primary goal of observation is to enable the analyst to experience the reality of the As-Is system. The information gained this way can be much better at conveying the actual situation than verbal descriptions. To improve the effectiveness of observation, the analyst should be as unobtrusive as possible. S/he should not interfere with or disrupt the workers being observed. The analyst should also try to observe periods of normal work as well as periods of unusual activity, to get a sense of what the typical experience is and also the special cases that need to be anticipated. The results of observation need to interpreted carefully, because the normal human response to being observed is to do things 'by the book,' rather than using the informal procedures that may have evolved. The analyst needs to remember this and not take everything that is observed as actual fact. The best use of observation is to confirm or verify information gained through other techniques.




7. Briefly describe the information is typically included in a system proposal?
Ans.: A system proposal brings together into a single comprehensive document the material created during planning and analysis. The system proposal typically includes an executive summary, the system request, the work plan, the feasibility analysis, the requirements definition, and the evolving models that describe the new system. The evolving models include functional models, structural models, and behavioral models. The executive summary provides all critical information in a very concise form. It can be thought of as a summary of the complete proposal.


8. Briefly describe the story cards and task lists requirements documentation techniques. What are some of the advantages of using story cards and task lists as a requirements gathering and documentation technique?

Ans.: Both story cards and task lists are considered to be “lite weight” approaches to documenting and gathering requirements. A story card is typically an index card with a single requirement (functional or non-functional) written on it. Once the requirement is written down, it is discussed to determine the amount of effort it will take to implement it. During the discussion, a task list is created for the requirement (story). If the requirement is deemed to be too large, i.e., there are too many tasks on the task list, the requirement is split up into multiple story cards and the tasks are allocated across the new stories. In many shops, once a set of tasks have been identified with a story, the story and its tasks are taped on a wall together so that all members of the development team may see the requirements. The story can be prioritized by importance by placing a rating on the card. The story can also be evaluated as to the level of risk associated with it. The importance level and amount of risk associated with the story can be used to help choose which requirements to implement first.

A set of advantages of using story cards and task lists to document requirements is that they are very low tech, high touch, easily updatable, and very portable.

9. Briefly explain the non-functional requirements and functional requirements in software quality.

Ans: One area of information systems development that focused on differentiating functional and non-­-functional requirements is software quality. There have been many different models proposed to measure the quality of software. However, virtually all of them differentiate functional and non-­-functional requirements. From a quality perspective, functional quality is related to the degree that the software meets the functional requirements, i.e., how much of the actual problem is solved by the software solution provided. Whereas, the non-­-functional requirements are associated with the efficiency, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, testability, and usability quality dimensions. As stated above, the non-­-functional related dimensions are associated primarily with the actual detailed design and implementation of the system.




10. Briefly explain the external and internal quality dimensions in ISO9000.

Ans: When considering ISO 9000 compliance, quality dimensions are further decomposed into those that the user can see (external) and those that the user cannot see (internal). The external non-­-functional dimensions include efficiency, reliability, and usability where the internal non-­-functional dimensions include maintainability, portability, reusability, and testability. From a user perspective, the external dimensions are more important. If the system is simply too difficult to use, regardless how well the system “solves” the problem, the user will simply not use the system. In other words, from a user’s perspective, for an information system to be successful, the system must not only meet the functional specification, but it must also meet the external non-­-functional specifications. From a developer perspective, the internal dimensions are also important. For example, given that successful systems tend to be long-­-lived and multi-­-platform, both the maintainability and portability dimensions can have strategic implications for the system being developed. Also, given the agile development approaches being used in industry today, the development of reusable and testable software is crucial.
