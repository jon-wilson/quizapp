Short Answer


1. Describe the custom development design strategy. Discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

Ans: During custom development the project team actually builds the new system from scratch. Advantages to custom development include control over the way the system looks and functions, flexibility and creativity in the way the business problem is solved; and the ability to build technical and functional knowledge within the company. Disadvantages to custom development include factors such as the use of an already over committed IS staff, a fully trained and experienced staff must already be in place before attempting custom development, and the risks (testing and recreating the wheel) associated with building a system from the ground up.


2. Describe the package system design strategy. Discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

Ans: Packaged software is the purchase of software for a non-unique business need. Advantages for buying packaged software include efficiency (the programs are already created, tested, and proven), quick installation, and the expertise and experience from the vendor who created the software. Disadvantages of packaged software include the functionality of the system is inflexible and may not be a perfect fit, and the new software package may not integrate with existing legacy software.


3. Describe the outsourcing design strategy. Discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

Ans: Outsourcing is when an external vendor, developer, or service provider is hired to create the system. This type of development strategy has increased in popularity recently. Advantages of outsourcing include factors such as the outsourcer may have more experience, technology, and resources. Outsourcing is often seen as adding value to the organization instead of reducing costs. A disadvantage to outsourcing is that the outsourcer gains the knowledge of building the new system and the customer does not.


4. Explain how the “business need” factor influences the selection of a design strategy for a project.

Ans: There are five characteristics of any design strategy. They are business need, in-house experience, project skills, project management, and the time frame.

Out of these five factors, if the business is quite common, there may be technical solutions in the market place that already meet this common business need. A common need means that the solution probably already exists in the marketplace and can be purchased in package software. A unique business need means a solution will need to be created from scratch by custom development. Non-core business needs can be outsourced.


5. Explain how the “in-house experience” factor influences the selection of a design strategy for a project.

Ans: The availability of in-house experience for all functional and technical needs is important. A packaged system is an alternative for organizations that do not have in-house technical experience. Outsourcing is a way to bring outside functional or technical experience into the organization that is missing in-house, but outsourcing does not build experience for the in-house staff.


6. Explain how the factor “project skills” influences the selection of a design strategy for a project.

Ans: Improving technical and functional project skills of in-house employees may be a strategic process within an organization. Custom development is good if an organization wishes to build in-house skills. Purchasing packaged software or outsourcing may be done if building skills is not strategic.


7. Explain how the “project management” factor influences the selection of a design strategy for a project.

Ans: Managing a custom developed system requires excellent in-house project management skills. Packaged software requires a project manager who can coordinate a vendor’s efforts. Outsourcing requires a highly skilled project manager at the level of the organization that matches the scope of the outsourcing deal.


8. Explain how the “time frame” factor influences the selection of a design strategy for a project.

Ans: The time frame for a project is an important characteristic. Custom development requires a very flexible time frame. It normally takes longer than expected. A packaged system can be implemented in a shorter time frame. Outsourcing may be completed in a flexible or short period depending on the size and scope.




9. Kiki, the marketing manager, and Joan, the director of information systems, have just returned from a conference on state-of-the art technology for marketing management. Each day after viewing vendor presentations and listening to other marketing managers discuss “what they don’t have and what they really need,” Kiki and Joan would brain storm ideas and record them in Joan’s laptop. On the flight home, Joan, a successful project manager, and Kiki, an experienced marketing professional, recognize that they have the foundation for a one-of-a-kind marketing management system that would improve the decisions the marketing staff must make. This new system could possibly change the way their primary products are marketed. In the process, this new system could save the company millions of dollars and possibly make millions more. Joan has an expert IS staff that is just completing a production management system. They are always interested in learning new technology and often request additional training. No new projects have been approved by the steering committee. What would you recommend Kiki and Joan do? Include in your discussion the design strategy selection process and the important characteristics that apply to the strategy selected.

Ans: I would recommend that Kiki and Joan make a formal request for a new marketing management system to the steering committee.

The new system should be custom developed because all of the following selection characteristics point towards that decision. The business need is unique and has been identified by marketing managers as a big money saver and maker.

Joan is identified as a successful project manager with an expert IS staff, so the in-house technical experience probably exist. Kiki is identified as an experienced marketing professional, so the in-house functional experience probably exists.

The IS staff have a history of building new in-house skills on prior projects and from continued professional training.

Joan is identified as a successful project manager that probably employees a proven methodology.

The time frame appears to be flexible since not projects are currently in the pipeline for development and the current project is about to be completed.




10. Mariana, the IS manager, has just received a note from the accounting department stating that they wish a new purchasing system could be placed on the priority list. The chief accounting officer (CAO) has just learned that three of their competitors have new purchasing systems. Since purchasing has not been considered a key business function in the past, the CAO is concerned that his department lacks the functional expertise to implement a new purchasing system. She feels that purchasing is becoming a strategic necessity for the company and a new system should be in place by this time next year. The CAO has managed the automation of numerous accounting functions, such as the purchase of a combined general ledger with accounts receivable and accounts payable, the custom development of a just-in-time inventory control system, and the management of a financial projections and stock funds project that was contracted to an outside vendor. What would you recommend Mariana do? Include in your discussion the design strategy selection process and the important characteristics that apply to the strategy selected.

Ans: Mariana should place a new purchasing system on the priority list if the funds are available to outsource the project. The reasons for outsourcing are quite clear. The business need is not unique, common to the business, or critical to the company. The accounting department lacks functional experience in the purchasing process (no mention is made of technical experience). The CAO has a vast amount of project management experience with many different types of oversight expertise, one of which was managing a project that was contracted to an outside vendor. The purchasing process is becoming more of a strategic concern of the organization and the decision to include this project on the priority list should be a strategic one. Finally, the time frame is about a year, which is short but flexible. All of the strategic characteristics point toward outsourcing as the type of development strategy.


11. Outsourcing can be a risky strategy to use when developing new information systems. Discuss ways to improve the likelihood of a successful outsourcing agreement.

Ans: First, select the outsourcer carefully. Find an outsourcer with whom you can establish a partnership arrangement; both sides should benefit from the contract. Second, be very clear on the requirements you have before signing the contract. Don't outsource what you don't understand. Third, assign someone to manage the outsourcing relationship. Don't assume it will maintain itself. Keep the line of communication open between you and your outsourcer. Finally, develop a contract that emphasizes flexible requirements, long-term relationships, and short-term contracts.




12. What is the purpose of an alternatives matrix? What is the typical content? How will this tool be used by a project team in the context of design strategy selection?

Ans: An alternatives matrix organizes the pros and cons of the design alternatives so that the best solution will be chosen in the end. On one side of the matrix, technical, budget, and organizational feasibility is listed, along with the pros and cons of each alternative plus any other pertinent information. The various system candidates are listed along the top of the matrix. In each cell of the grid, detailed information on each alternative is inserted. The alternatives matrix provides a concise representation of the relevant issues on each option in an easily compared format. The team may just use it to facilitate discussion. Or, the team may assign weights to each of the factors, and then score each alternative on each factor, enabling them to compute a weighted average score for each alternative. This quantification may help the team identify the alternative that provides the best overall 'package' of feasibility.


13. Briefly describe the five different software layers.

Ans: The foundation layer contains classes that are necessary for any object-oriented application to exist, such as fundamental data types, data structures, and abstractions.

The system architecture layer addresses how the software will execute on specific computers and networks. This layer includes classes that deal with communications between the software and the operating system and the network. This also includes classes that would interact with middleware applications.

The human-computer interaction layer contains the classes associated with the implementation of the user interface. This deals with issues like the navigation through the system, help system, and the types of input and output elements to be included.

The data management layer addresses the issues involving the persistence of the objects contained in the system. The types of classes that appear in this layer deal with how objects can be stored and retrieved.

The problem domain layer is the layer that the majority of this course focuses on – the actual business problem that the system is designed to address.




14. Describe the five-step process for creating package diagrams.

Ans: First, set the context for the package diagram. Second, cluster the classes together into partitions based on the relationships that the classes share. Third, place the clustered classes together in a partition and model the partitions as packages. Fourth, identify the dependency relationships among the packages. Fifth, place the dependency relationships on the evolved package diagram.


15. What is an “object wrapper” and how can one be used to help integrate systems?

Ans: An object wrapper is an object that wraps around a legacy system, enabling an object-oriented system to send messages to the legacy system. Object wrappers create an application program interface (API) to the legacy system. This allows a firm to retain their investment in their legacy systems while integrating them with their object-oriented systems.


16. Give some example classes that can appear on each of the layer of software architecture.

Ans: Answers will vary. Some suggestions are below:

LayersSample ClassesFoundationDate, Enumeration (They include classes that represent fundamental data types, classes that represent fundamental data structures, sometimes referred to as container classes, and classes that represent useful abstractions, sometimes referred to as utility classes.)Problem DomainEmployee, Customer (Domain classes, further detail the classes so that it will be possible to implement them in an effective and efficient manner.Data Access and ManagementDataInputStream, FileInputStream (The types of classes that appear in this layer deal with how objects can be stored and retrieved.)Human–Computer InteractionButton, Panel	(Typical classes found on this layer include classes that can be used to represent buttons, windows, text fields, scroll bars, check boxes, drop-down lists, and many other classes that represent user interface elements.)Physical ArchitectureServerSocket, URLConnection (classes that deal with communication between the software and the computer’s operating system and the network).



17. What is the purpose of the different layers?

Ans: To successfully evolve the analysis model of the system into a design model of the system, we must add the system environment information. One useful way to do this, without overloading the developer, is to use layers.
