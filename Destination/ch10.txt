Short Answer

1. What are the six User Interface Design Principles? Identify each principle and provide a description for each.

Ans: The six User Interface Design Principles are layout, content awareness, aesthetics, user experience, consistency, and minimal user effort. Layout refers to a series of areas on the screen that are used consistently for different purposes. For example, the top is for commands and navigation, the middle is for input and output, and the bottom is for status information. For content awareness, the users should be aware of where they are in the system and what information is being displayed. The principle for aesthetics proposes that the interface should be functional and inviting to use. There should be careful use of white space, colors, and fonts. User experience refers to the ease of use and ease of learning. There are often tradeoffs between these two concepts. Novice users or infrequent users will prefer ease of learning, whereas frequent users will prefer ease of use. Consistency in interface design enables user to predict what will happen before they perform a function. It is one of the most important elements in ease of learning, ease of use, and aesthetics. The interface should require minimal user effort. Most designers plan on having no more than three mouse clicks from the starting menu until users perform work.


2. Quarters, Inc. is a company that sells maps of the U.S.A. that have pre-fitted holes corresponding to the recently release quarters with state emblems on the back. The maps are display cases and collectors guides for families or individuals participating in the program. Six months ago the marketing manager requested a new system that would allow retailers of the maps to order them in packs of fifty over the Internet. Three retailers are local and have volunteered to participate in a half-day evaluation of the new system. The new web-based system is almost complete. As the IS testing manager you have been assigned the task of testing the new system. Describe the four methods for interface evaluation and make a recommendation on the appropriate method or methods that would best fit the system described.

Ans: The four common approaches to interface evaluation are heuristic evaluation, walk-through evaluation, interactive evaluation, and formal usability testing. Heuristic evaluation examines the interface by comparing it to a set of rules or principles for interface design. Three or more members of the team evaluate each screen using a checklist that was developed at the beginning of the project. After each screen has been evaluated the team meets, shares evaluations, and identifies specific improvements. For a walk-through evaluation, the project team has a meeting with the users and performs a walk-through of the interface prototype. The project team shows the storyboard or actually demonstrates the prototype and explains how the interface is to be used. Users identify improvements. During an interactive evaluation the users work with the prototype in a one-person session with a member of the project team. The team member records the difficult cases, when the user makes mistakes, or when misinterpretations are made.

Formal usability testing is commonly done with commercial software products and products developed by large organizations that will be widely used throughout the organization. A scientific process is performed that may include lab equipment, video cameras, and special software that records every keystroke and mouse operation.

I would recommend heuristic evaluation and/or walk-through evaluation. All systems should be evaluated heuristically against a checklist prior to being evaluated by customers or users. In this specific example three local retailers have volunteered to test the system for half a day. To best use their volunteer time a walk-through evaluation suits well. The team would show the retailers the prototype and explain how the interface will be used. The retailer would identify improvements to each interface.

3. Describe the typical layout areas for a standard screen, a Web screen, and a report screen.

Ans: For a typical screen, three areas are defined. First, there is a box along the top that contains the navigation commands. Second, there is a box along the bottom that is the status area, displaying information about what the user is doing. Third, the remainder large central area of the screen is used for the primary content of the screen: displaying a report or displaying an input form, for example. A Web screen will be similar, but often provides many more navigation areas than a standard screen. There will usually be a navigation area at the top, which is used to give commands to the browser for the overall system. There is often another navigation area along the left side of the screen, containing a navigation mechanism to more between sections of the page. There may also be navigation controls at the top of the page itself and at the bottom of the page itself. In Web pages, it is essential to always let the user know where they are and how to move, so there is a lot of emphasis on navigation features. Report screens will also make use of smaller, specialized areas on the screen. Each report area may show a different type of information and is somewhat self-contained.


4. Describe the five steps of the user interface design process. Why is this process iterative?

Ans: The first step is to review the sequence diagrams and use cases to identify use scenarios. These scenarios describe users' commonly employed patterns of action, enabling designers to focus on creating an interface that performs these actions quickly and smoothly. Second, the designers create the window navigation diagram that defines the basic structure of the interface. Third, interface standards are developed for the basic interface design elements. Fourth, the interface design elements are prototyped. Finally, the interface is evaluated by the end users. This process will be iterative in that user feedback usually suggests improvements for the interface, which results in a repeated cycle through these steps until the users are satisfied.




5. Analysts must assume that users have not read the manual, have not attended training, and do not have external help readily available. To confront these realities, navigation controls must be designed with three basic principles. Identify and define these three principles. Provide an example for each.

Ans: The three basic design principles for navigation controls are prevent mistakes, simplify recovery from mistakes, and use consistent grammar order. Mistakes can be reduced by labeling commands and actions appropriately and by limiting choices. Too many choices can confuse the user, particularly when they are similar and hard to describe in the short space on a screen. Two examples to prevent mistakes would be to never display a command that cannot be used and to consider using a second level of menu. To simplify the recovery from mistakes the system should make it as easy as possible to correct errors. The Window menu has an undo command built in. This feature is often too complicated to write into application software. The use of consistent grammar order can easily be implemented by making each command an “action-object order.” This is the most common method and most users are familiar with the format. For example, save a file has an action-object order (save is an action, file is the object).


6. Michelle and Tom have been assigned the task of creating the menu system for a new software package. They have been given the following information about the system and the prospective users of the system. There are to be only two types of menus used. The users of the new system are very familiar with Windows applications, but are considered “novices.” The primary menu items should be just one word that leads to other menus. The second-level can be multiple words that perform actions. Due to limited development time image maps and toolbars should be excluded from the selection process. What types of menus would you recommend Michelle and Tom? Define each and support yourAnswer.

Ans: There are six types of menus: menu bars, drop-down menus, pop-up menus, tab menus, toolbars, and image maps. The question does not permit the use of image maps or toolbars. Pop-up menus would not be suitable because they are not appropriate for novice users. Tab menus only permit one row of tabs (or commands) and at this point we are not sure how many we will need. The recommended menu types should be menu bar for the primary menu and drop-down menu for the secondary menu. Menu bars are a list of commands at the top of the screen that are always on the screen and act as the main menu for the system. Menu items on menu bars are always one word that lead to secondary menus. Drop-down menus drop down immediately below another menu and disappear after use. They are second-level menus that often drop from a menu bar. Drop-down menus can be multiple words that perform actions.




7. Why is it important to capture data at the source and how is this process best done?

Ans: Capturing data at the source is perhaps the most important input design principle. The earlier in the process data is entered into electronic format the less opportunity there is for errors to enter the system. Entering data onto a paper form that is then entered into an electronic format is an expensive duplication of work. Doing the data entry process twice, once on paper and a second into electronic format, is expensive and the duplicate process creates two opportunities for error. Capturing data at the source is called source data automation. Bar code readers, optical character readers, magnetic stripe readers, and smart cards are the most common forms of source data automation. An online form, such as an application or a customer order, is also a method of capturing data at the source. The customer entering the data via a form is less expensive and more error free than a customer service representative performing the data entry.


8. The Dean of Admissions at State University would like to have an online application process for all prospective students. The online application will have the following field: first, middle, and last name; street, city, state, and zip address; phone; date of birth; and social security number. What types of input validation would you perform on each field? Support your answer.

Ans: There are six types of input validation: completeness check, format check, range check, check digit check, consistency checks, and database checks. All of the fields would be checked for completeness. All information would be required before the form could be processed. The numeric fields of zip code, phone, date of birth, and social security number would be checked for format. Each is all numeric with a pre-defined format. For example, date of birth is defined as month, day, and year. The numeric fields should also be validated for range to guaranty that only numbers between the correct values are used. For example, a home phone number does not normally have the area codes of 800 or 900, and date of birth cannot have a day above 31 or a month above 12. Consistency check can be performed for two or more fields that are related. For example, a zip code within a state should match the state’s available zip codes and a phone number area code should match a state’s available area codes. Database checks would not be performed on new applicants that are not currently in State University’s database.


9. Discuss three design principles that can improve the usability of menus.

Ans: First, design the menus to be broad and shallow rather than narrow and deep. A broad and shallow structure places more choices in front of the user initially and makes it easier for them to find the desired command. Second, try to organize the menus to achieve the ideal of no more than eight items per menu, and not more than two mouse clicks or keystrokes from any menu to the desired action. Third, construct the menus so that similar categories of items are put together so that the user can intuitively guess what each menu contains. One strategy that helps is to group menu items by interface objects rather than by actions. This way, all actions pertaining to each object are contained in the same menu.


10. Distinguish between batch processing and on-line processing. What are the pros and cons of each input method? Under what circumstances is it best to use each?

Ans: With batch processing, transaction data is accumulated over some natural period (such as a day) and processed as a group. With this method, the organization's files do not reflect the transactions until the batch has been accumulated and processed. With on-line processing, a transaction is processed as it occurs, and the organization's files reflect the transaction immediately. With this method, the organization's files are always up-to-date. Batch processing is generally simpler to implement and has lower communications costs; however, on-line processing is required in situations where files must have real-time content.


11. Discuss three ways a system designer can improve the usability of the system's reports?

Ans: First, know how the report will be used. Clarify what the user looks for, the order in which the information is desired, and the categories that can be used to organize the information appropriately. Second, provide all necessary and sufficient information to the user, but do not provide more than the user needs. Also, if the user wants the same information presented different ways for different decision making purposes, then create different reports for each purpose. Do not try to make a comprehensive, multi-purpose report. It will probably be unusable. Third, look for possible bias in the way the report content is presented. Bias can be subtle and unintended, but present just the same.


12. Discuss the problem of bias with regard to graphical outputs.

Ans: Bias is especially problematic in graphical output because the size effect of changes or trends can be manipulated through the choice of the scale used. To help avoid this, always start graph axes scales at zero




13. With regards to social media, what is the difference between “push” and “pull” approaches to interacting with customers?

Ans: If the user must come to you to find out something, then you are using a pull-based approach. On the other hand, if you put the information out to the user, then you are using a push-based approach. When it comes to social media, you really need to use a combination of the approaches. For example, in Facebook if someone posts on your wall or sends you a request, Facebook will send you an email message to try an entice you back to the Facebook site. The act of posting to your site was a pull-based action, while the email message sent to you is a push-based action. In a nutshell, you want to focus on more of a push-based approach. You want your content to get to your customers in as an effective manner as possible. You don’t want them to have to come looking for you. Encourage them to opt-in for update notifications to come to them in a form that they prefer. Some may prefer email notifications, while others may prefer you post to their Facebook or Twitter accounts. Also, be sure to include links to your social media sites on your home page. But, be sure not to overwhelm the customer. Not every customer wants to know every tidbit regarding the firm. Only give the customer what the customer wants. Remember, Krug’s first principle: Don’t Make Me Think! A corollary to this principle for social media would be: Don’t Make Me Work! So, make it easy for the customer to find only what they want (or maybe what we want them to want).

14. What is occlusion? Why is it an issue when developing multi-dimensional information visualizations? What are augmented reality systems? What are Virtual reality systems?

Ans: Occlusion is when viewing data in 3D, some of the visualization may be covered up, hidden, by other parts of the visualization. It blocks information in the back. Augmented and virtual reality using immersive technologies, is among the latest and exciting application areas being utilized to solve business problems. Where virtual reality (VR) technologies completely immerse the user into an artificial simulated digital environment, augmented reality (AR) technologies are used to augment or enhance the view of the real world. There are both opportunities and challenges with deploying both of these technologies.

15. What are some of the multilingual issues that you may face when developing for a global audience?

Ans: Global applications often have multilingual requirements, which means that they have to support users who speak different languages and write using non-English letters (e.g., those with accents, Cyrillic, Japanese). One of the most challenging aspects in designing global systems is getting a good translation of the original language messages into a new language. Words often have similar meanings but can convey subtly different meanings when they are translated, so it is important to use translators skilled in translating technical words.




16. When developing a virtual reality system, what are some of the issues that need to be addresses?

Ans: Obviously, designing effective and efficient VR applications is very difficult39. Again, the overall design process is similar to the general user interface design process described earlier. However, given the potential for VR to support business decision-making by combining gaming and information visualization technologies into a single seamless distributed environment and that the investment in specialized hardware and software is dropping, VR could provide large payoffs.


17. What is a cognitive map?

Ans: A cognitive map consists of not only spatial relationships, but also of auditory, sensory and emotional impressions. In games, a map is typically provided to help with change "is" to "are" understanding where one is in the virtual space and from where one has come. Like the immersion issue, way-finding also raises issues related to individual psychological and cognitive differences.


18. What are the six suggestions to address the mobile computing challenges?

Ans: Based on these challenges, Tidwell provides a set of suggestions that you should follow in designing a user interface for these devices. First, given the mobile context, you really need to focus on what the user needs and not what the user may want. In other words, you really should go back to business process and functional modeling (Chapter 4). In this case, only focus on the tasks that the user will need to perform when they are in the mobile context. This is a good example of a non-functional requirement (mobile computing) impacting the possible functional requirements.

Second, if you are porting an application or web site to a mobile device, remove all “fluff” from the site. By that we mean, strip the site down to its bare essentials. If for some reason, the user needs access to the full site, be sure to provide a link to it in an obvious location. Alternatively, you could provide a complete mobile version of the application or web site to the user. Obviously, the design of the user interface will be different, but the functionality should be the same.

Third, whenever possible, take advantage of the unique capabilities built into these devices. Some of the devices will have GPS built-in. Depending on your application, knowing where the user is could change the results. In other cases, devices such as the iPad, have an accelerometer that allows the app to “know” the orientation of the device. Many of devices have speech recognition capabilities, cameras that can be used for scanning, touch screens that allow sophisticated gestures to be used, and haptic feedback, such as bumps and vibrations. All of these capabilities could prove useful in developing different mobile applications.

Fourth, when considering a phone, you tend to have a limited width from which to work. Consequently, you should try to linearize the content of the application (see Figure 10-25). By that we mean, take advantage of vertical scrolling and try to minimize, if not eliminate, horizontal scrolling. It is simply more natural for users to scroll up and down instead of left to right on these devices.

Fifth, optimize your mobile application for the user. This will include minimizing the number of times the device must interact with a server to download or upload information with a server. Not everyone will have access to 3G, alone true 4G, networks. In many cases, uploading and downloading is still very slow. Optimization also includes the user’s interaction with the device. Instead of using a lot of typing, scrolling, and taps on a touch screen, consider using the speech recognition capability. It’s a lot easier to speak slowly to a smartphone than it is to have to type a lot into a virtual or physical keyboard.

Finally, Tidwell provides a set of reusable patterns that have been customized for mobile devices. These include things such as a vertical stack, filmstrip, and bottom navigation to name a few.
